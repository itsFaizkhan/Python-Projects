🌤 Current Weather Data Analysis & Automation
📌 Project Overview
In this project, I built an automated pipeline that fetches real-time current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, cleans it, analyzes patterns, and creates visualizations — all in one workflow. The goal was to practice API integration, data cleaning, and analysis while making the process fully automated.
🔎 What I Did
Connected to the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API to collect live data (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Cleaned and prepared the dataset: converted dates, handled missing values, and extracted day and hour features.
Performed analysis such as:
Daily average weather conditions.
Hourly trends for temperature, humidity, and wind.
Identified peak temperature and wind speed hours each day.
Created visualizations (line plots, bar charts) to show daily and hourly weather insights.
Automated the workflow to:
Save cleaned datasets as CSV files with timestamps.
Save visualizations as PNG files automatically.
✅ Outcomes / What I Achieved
A reusable script that can pull, clean, and analyze current weather data for any city.
Automated reporting → data and plots are saved daily without manual steps.
Hands-on practice with API requests, pandas, seaborn/matplotlib, and automation workflows.
Built a project that can scale to real-world applications in energy systems, smart cities, or weather-based decision-making.
🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (pandas, numpy, requests, matplotlib, seaborn)
OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API
📂 Outputs Generated
weather_analysis_YYYYMMDD.csv → Cleaned dataset
weather_daily_summary_YYYYMMDD.csv → Daily averages
daily_weather_summary_YYYYMMDD.png → Daily trends
hourly_trends_YYYYMMDD.png → Hourly weather insights
👉 This project gave me hands-on experience in working with live data streams, automating reports, and turning raw weather data into actionable insights.
